This project delves into predicting temperature changes using historical data through the application of diverse supervised learning models. The dataset, containing information on temperature variations over time, underwent meticulous preprocessing to address missing values and outliers. Employing regression models such as Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR, and XGBoost, the study aimed to visualize trends, compare model performances, and assess robustness. Evaluation metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) provided a comprehensive understanding of model strengths and weaknesses. The introduction of bootstrap resampling techniques enhanced the robustness assessment, elucidating the stability of the models through metrics like mean MSE and R-squared.
